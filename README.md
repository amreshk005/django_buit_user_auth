# django_buit_user_auth

django-user-profiles

A flexible app that wires together Django's user authentication and user profile features, with customizable forms and models. Furthermore, it provides a layer for user profile activation, plus support for a multiple-profiles-per-user feature.

This app also aims to offer some improvements where the standard django.contrib.auth app is too limited.

Given the appropriate configuration, you can implement various login/signup paradigms:

Sign up with username and email – confirm email address – proceed to log in with generated password (not implemented)
Sign up with email and password – confirm email address – proceed to log in
Sign up with email and password – proceed to log in – confirm email address later to use advanced features
Sign up with username and password – proceed to log in – add email address later – confirm email address.
*reset password
*login
